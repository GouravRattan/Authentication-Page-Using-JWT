# Project Title

## Authentication Project with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

### Overview

This project is an authentication system that leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication. The use of JWT provides a scalable and stateless solution, enhancing security and user experience.

### Features

- **Token-Based Authentication:** Uses JWTs for secure and stateless user authentication.
- **Token Expiry:** Implements token expiration to enhance security.
- **Refresh Tokens:** Optionally supports refresh tokens for obtaining new JWTs without re-entering credentials.
- **Password Hashing:** Safely stores passwords with hashing techniques.
- **Cross-Origin Support:** Facilitates secure cross-origin requests.
- **Token Revocation:** Allows for token revocation in case of security concerns or user logout.

### Getting Started

1. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   npm install
Configuration:

Configure your environment variables for database connection, JWT secret, etc.
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
